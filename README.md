AppManifestFixeroo
==================

Run this in your steamapps folder (or wherever else Steam has stored appmanifest_123.acf files) to repair the situation where games such as demos have been removed from your library before downloads completed, resulting in the Windows 7/8 taskbar progress indicator getting stuck permanently halfway even after restarting and 'cleaning' Steam.

All files listed in the output should be deleted/checked manually.
